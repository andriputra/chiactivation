            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>There is a popular theory going around that all energy is really the same. The idea, presumably, is to be inclusive and non-judgmental – to not offend anyone. 
                    <br/>
                    Or maybe it connected to the popular idea that all spiritual traditions simply point back to the same place (God, Source, call it what you will) and so are really, on a fundamental level, the same. 
                    <br/>
                    There is truth and good intentions behind all of this, but to say that all energy is the same is nevertheless laughable. That’s like saying that all humans are the same. 
                    <br/>
                    Yes, we may biologically be near identical. Our intrinsic worth may be the same. But even so, how we express ourselves on a daily basis is vastly different: 
                    <br/>
                    The introvert is different from the extrovert. 
                    The uptight Oxford professor is different from the karaoke loving, Latin dancer. The macho, in-your-face, alpha male is different from the timid, energetically sensitive, heart-chakra-centric feminine type. This isn’t a value judgement. It’s just pointing 
                    <br/>
                    <span class="quote">"Everyone is different - and so too is energy"</span>
                    <br/>
                    You have solid, grounding vibrations. <br/>
                    You have light, airy vibrations. 
                    You have exhilarating vibrations, calming vibrations and everything in between (and beyond!).
                    <br/>
                    And that is why it is useful to learn more than one healing modality, because each modality helps you connect to different energies.
                    <br/>
                    Think of it like speaking an ‘energy’ language. Learn another modality and you learn to speak another one, and as a result, successfully ‘communicate’ and heal more people/issues/conditions.

            <h2>the problem with traditional<br/>Healing methods</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>When traditional Western medicine proclaims that there is ‘no cure’ for a particular issue, all this actually means is that using their techniques and tools, they don’t have cure!
                    If you look at things logically, every emotional and physical issue is ultimately the result of an energetic imbalance (everything, at its core, is energy, after all). But if the problem is caused by an energetic imbalance, then the cure is simply to balance the energy.
                    <br/>
                    This is not necessarily a simple task, but it should – logically speaking – always be possible. Take the human body’s organs, for example. When they are healthy and functioning well, they vibrate in a certain energy frequency range. When they become unhealthy, however, they begin to vibrate outside of this range.
                    <br/>
                    So to restore health, what is needed is to get them functioning inside the healthy vibrational range once more. This, fundamentally, is what healing modalities (like Reiki, Pellowah, etc.) do. 
                    They use chi to help the body rebalance itself.
                    This can work in one of two ways:

                <h2>For Connoisseurs of Chi</h2>
                <p>Chi Activation is for anyone who loves chi. 
                    It is for anyone who hates limitations and wants to dive deep into the unlimited world of energy frequencies. Because it ultimately teaches you to connect to unlimited healing frequencies, your healing growth will never plateau. You will never find yourself growing bored or doing the same treatment time and time again.
                    <br/>
                    No, you will learn how to tune into the exact healing frequency you need for optimal results – something that will naturally vary from person to person.  As a result, things will always stay fresh and fun. 
                    <br/>
                    The more you learn and practise Chi Activation, the more you’ll get to explore a never-ending energy wonderland full of creativity and surprises
                    <br/>
                    If this sounds hard, if it sounds like it is beyond you, then don’t worry. Chi Activation works by leveraging the natural abilities of the human body.
                    <br/>
                    All bodies are equipped to connect to energy. All bodies can tap into an infinite amount of healing frequencies. So you don’t need to be special. 
                    You don’t need a psychic to tell you that you are a ‘healer’ (although it is always nicely affirming when they do!). You simply need to be YOU.
                    <br/>
                    You have the ‘machinery’ (like a radio) to tune into thousands and thousands of frequencies, it is just a question of learning how to do it. And this is what Chi Activation will teach you to do.

                <h2>Systematic Learning<br/> for Concrete Results</h2>
                <p>Chi Activation has three levels. Each level takes you deeper into the wonderful world of energy. Each level teaches you to connect to more and more frequencies.
                    <br/>
                    In level 1, you learn to tap into five powerful types of energy – each type connected to a chakra.
                    Where things get even more interesting is that two of the chakras – the Earth Star Chakra and the Soul Star Chakra – are not found in your physical body, but rather in your auric field.
                    <br/>
                    What this means is that you end up with a far greater range of healing energy to play with.
                    You have the super-grounding energy of the Earth Star Chakra, and ultra-fine high-vibrational energy of the Soul Star Chakra.
                    <br/>
                    Combine these with the energies of the crown, throat and heart chakras, and it means you will be able to access a vast spread of healing energy – something that will dramatically improve your chances of finding an energy that can help with whatever issue you are dealing with. As impressive as this is (and it is basically five times the healing range of regular single-frequency healing modalities), level 2 really amps things up.
                    <br/>
                    Here, you learn to tap into an unlimited amount of healing frequencies. You are given the universal ‘key’ that opens all doors. As a result, you can now practice ‘vibrational balancing’. This allows you to find the optimal energy frequency for whatever issue you are confronted with.
                    <br/>
                    Since every negative condition (both physical and emotional) is a result of an energetic imbalance, if you find the counter-balance, the ideal, balancing frequency, then you can bring the body, emotions and spirit back into a state of harmony and wellbeing.
                    <br/>
                    Of course, the final level – the Chi Activation Master Level – takes things further still. Here you learn to go beyond healing with the hands to ‘whole body’ healing. By using your entire body as an energy channeling machine, you can generate a lot more energy than with the hands alone and thus perform more powerful healing.
                    <br/>
                    In the Master Level, you will also learn to use your mind for complex and powerful healing – something that will add immense depth to the work you do. Finally, in the Master Level, you will learn how to teach others Chi Activation.

            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>You can even use it to clear and charges spaces, like your home, bedroom, or office.
                    So from the moment you learn it, you’ll be able to use it every day in supremely practical ways.
                    <br/>
                    Better still, the energy will even flow in noisy or unsettled environments (like when your kids are fighting, your husband is watching the footy and shouting at the screen, and your neighbours are having a techno party).
                    <br/>
                    Heck, you can even channel Chi Activation energy while you are talking, watching the TV, or doing all sorts of other things. 
                    <br/>
                    This might not be as rich a meditative experience as when you are sitting in your room alone in silence. But the energy will still flow – and flow strongly!

            <h2>who is chi activation for?<br/> "Powerful things – when taught well – are often surprisingly simple."</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Chi Activation is brilliant for experienced healers and healing beginners alike.
                    Jeremy first created it after practising meditation and healing for almost 25 years, and it enabled him to go far deeper into his healing work than ever before.
                    <br/>
                    That said, because everyone is naturally equipped to do energy work, and because Chi Activation uses ‘activations’ to enable students to immediately tune into healing frequencies, it is also great for healing beginners. 
                    <br/>
                    So if you are starting out on your healing journey or looking to go beyond the limits of your current healing modality, and if you are looking for a healing system with the potential for unlimited growth, then you’ll love Chi Activation.
                    <br/>
                    When it comes to connecting to chi energy for hands-on/hands-off healing, it is the most complete system available, and is perfect for anyone who wants to better nurture and heal themselves, their family, their friends, and quite possibly even strangers. With three levels, you can even go on to teach and 
                    work as a Chi Activation healer.
                    <br/>

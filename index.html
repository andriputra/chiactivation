            <div class="paragraph one">
                <h4>Chi. Energy. Prana. Ki. Shakti.</h4>
                <p>Healing energy has lots of names, but whatever you call it, it is the life force that permeates our being, that nourishes our body and uplifts our spirit. It is also the energy that soothes and balances our emotions, that supports us when life gets challenging, that inspires us to become the brightest version of ourselves that we can be. It gives us the clarity to live on purpose, the energy to follow our intuition, and the zest to enjoy life to the fullest.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph two">
                <h4>healing body and mind</h4>
                <p>Due to the incredible power of chi, it is not surprising that healing systems have evolved all worldwide that teach us to connect to and channel it. Almost all of them work well, and they consistently have success dealing with physical and emotional issues – even in instances where traditional Western medicine struggles.
                    <br/>
                    This might seem surprising at first glance, but it actually makes a lot of sense. If most issues (physical/emotional) have a mind-body connection, then simply removing, say, a tumor, or giving someone a drug, will rarely fix the root issue of the condition.

            <div class="paragraph">
                <h4>a holistic approach</h4>
                <p>As such, the issue will frequently return or manifest in other negative forms. This is one reason alternative (‘complementary’) healing methods have grown in popularity in recent years, because they treat the WHOLE person, not just the symptom. When done well, they help to heal a person on physical, emotional and mental levels simultaneously – something that produces deep, ‘multi-layered’ healing.
                    <br/>
                    As a result, complementary healing methods often fix the root cause of an issue, something that not only facilitates a return to good health, but also profoundly impacts an individual’s overall wellbeing and happiness.

            <h2>How Energy Healing Works </h2>
            <h2>and its challenges</h2>
            <p>When traditional Western medicine proclaims that there is ‘no cure’ for a particular issue, all this actually means is that using their techniques and tools, they don’t have cure!
                If you look at things logically, every emotional and physical issue is ultimately the result of an energetic imbalance (everything, at its core, is energy, after all). But if the problem is caused by an energetic imbalance, then the cure is simply to balance the energy.
                <br/>
                This is not necessarily a simple task, but it should – logically speaking – always be possible. Take the human body’s organs, for example. When they are healthy and functioning well, they vibrate in a certain energy frequency range. When they become unhealthy, however, they begin to vibrate outside of this range.
                <br/>
                So to restore health, what is needed is to get them functioning inside the healthy vibrational range once more. This, fundamentally, is what healing modalities (like Reiki, Pellowah, etc.) do. 
                They use chi to help the body rebalance itself.
                This can work in one of two ways:

                    <h4>The Reiki/Pellowah/etc.</h4>
                    <p>The Reiki/Pellowah/etc.frequency acts as a balancing force to help draw the body/organ/energy body into healthy alignment, and as a result, create good health (be it mental, emotional, or physical).</p>

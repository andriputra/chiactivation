            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Let’s be honest: as a healer, it is easy to spend all of our time running around helping and 
                    healing others, and little time nurturing our own wellbeing. But if you want to go deeper into any healing system, if you want to become the best healer and teacher you can become, then the foundation of everything you do is your personal practice. This is what sustains you when you are going through challenges. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    This is what helps you to stay energetically grounded when working on energetically unbalanced clients and students. This is what enables you to channel ever-greater quantities of chi and truly amp up the power of the healing work that you do. But if your foundation is weak, if you don’t tend to yourself first, then when times get rough, your inner balance and health may suffer.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In the Master Level, we therefore begin by teaching you several advanced techniques for greater emotional wellbeing, clarity and inner balance. Techniques include:

                <p class="column-2">
                    Your mind is going to fill up with something. The question is simply what? If you don’t tend to the information flowing into it, then you get the societal default. You get all of the junk in the news. You get the whining of your friends. 
                    <br/>
                    You get the hopes, dreams and theories of dissatisfied people. The sum total of all of this becomes your mind’s ‘operating system’.
                    <br/><br/>
                    It becomes the filter through which it sees and interprets the world. To be happy, however, to be the best version of YOU that you can be, you need to take charge of your mental ‘operating system’ by feeding your mind the ‘right’ kind of stuff. It is here that the Chi Activation Precepts come in. 
                    <br/>
                    Go through them in the morning before you start your day, and you will be programming yourself to make the most of it, programming yourself to tune in to the brightest of YOU that you can be. The precepts will be your anchor when your day gets stormy. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    They will be your rocket ship when you want to fly. Along with ‘vibrational meditation’, they will help your day flow more brightly.

                <h2 class="uppercase text-center">‘Core Being’ Meditation:</h2>
                <p class="text-center">They say you don’t want to get to the top of the ladder only to realize that it is leaning up against the wrong wall. So often in life, we run helter-skelter in a direction, we work super hard for a result, only to realize later on that while ‘successful’, our success doesn’t really fulfil us. In fact, in many cases, we realize that we weren’t really doing things because they were ‘true to who we are’, but rather, we did them out of social obligation, expectation, or because we had absorbed societal values – values that weren’t true to us!
                    <br/><br/>
                    In the ‘core being’ meditation, you learn to connect to the core of your being. Once you do this, then making the right kind of life decisions becomes far easier. No longer are you choosing a direction in reaction to the world around you. Rather, you are being guided by your inner being, 
                    by your higher wisdom.

                The Chi Activation Master Level is not just about teaching you to teach. It is about further enhancing your healing skills so that you can get even more out of your innate ability, even more out of the healing work you have done so far. Already, level 2 was a big jump up from level 1. 
                But the Chi Activation Master Level is where we take things to their most advanced level.

                    <h2>Healing ‘String Technique’:</h2>
                    <p> With this healing method, you learn to set healing frequencies ‘in place’ while you simultaneously heal with additional ones. In this way, you can have multiple healing frequencies working together for enhanced power and healing.</p>

                    <p> No doubt you are already good at working intuitively. In this course, however, we help you learn to let yourself be guided to the perfect healing frequency for your client. Beyond that, the technique also amps up the energy flow of your healing.</p>

                    Using this technique, we are able to greatly amplify our ability to use our body to help realign and balance the energy of our clients. Make the jump from simple healing with the hands to healing with the entire body and you’ll experience an immediate shift in the quality of your healing.</p>

                    <h2>Removing Healing Blocks:</h2>
                    <p>Every condition carries with it some benefit. <br/>
                        A child is sick, so he gets to stay home from school and enjoy extra attention from his mum. A person struggles around crowds, and he now has an excuse to avoid annoying social engagements.  These are simpli-fications, and a lot of the time the benefit to a condition is not initially obvious, but until someone truly wants to heal (both con-sciously and unconsciously), it will be a challenge for them to get the most out of your work. Learning to remove ‘healing blocks’ is therefore critical to the success of a healer and something we work on in the course.

                    You want your energy to be felt positively by others. You want to expand your meridians so you can channel greater and greater quantities of  healing energy.

                <p class="column-2">
                    You can give a person a fish, or you can teach them to fish. So goes the old saying, and it is as true as ever with healing. You can give someone a healing session, and it will certainly help clear energy blocks, grant insights, and improve a general sense of wellbeing (to name just a tiny fraction of the benefits), but if you want long-term, sustained healing, nothing beats teaching someone to heal themselves. For teach them to connect to energy frequencies, and they can give themselves as much healing as they desire, each and every day.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Over time, all of this healing accumulates and compounds, thus creating the kind of shifts that are hard to achieve with only a few healing sessions – no matter how good the practitioner.What’s more, when a person can heal themselves, they feel empowered. This shifts their perception of the world and helps them understand that they never need be a ‘victim’. They always have the power to shift their energetic and emotional state and to help others shift theirs. 
                    <br/>
                    For the founder of Chi Activation, Jeremy O’Carroll, this is one of the greatest gifts we could ever give anyone - Indeed, it is a life-changing gift.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In your Master Level course, you will learn how to do Chi Activation attunements, and how to teach this flexible and powerful method to others. Teaching others is one of the most satisfying things that you can do. Empowering them to heal themselves makes your healing work truly meaningful. It will also – thanks to the ripple effect – help your students’ family, friends and all those who come in contact with them. If you want to make a difference in the world, if you want to help raise the planet’s vibration, then teaching others to heal is one of the most powerful ways to do so.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Apart from the mechanics of teaching, this section will also teach you about the ‘psychology of teaching’ and how to avoid the most common mistakes even experienced healers make!

                <div class="text-center">
                    All students must have completed Chi Activation Levels 1 and 2, and waited a minimum of 6 months between level 2 and the Master Level. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    This ensures that students have the time to practise and absorb the techniques learned in the earlier levels, and as a result, get the most out of the course.

                    Like all of the best healing modalities, Chi Activation is at its heart a spiritual practice. In other words, it helps connect you to your ‘Inner Self’ (Higher Self/ True Self). In doing this, it expands your awareness, heightens clarity, and helps you to better live your Path. The meditation element of Chi Activation is critical in helping you connect to your True Self, and you will use it both as a stand-alone practice, and in conjunction with your healing work.

                    <h2 class="text-pink">tune in with your inner self</h2>
                    <p>One of the great things about Chi Activation Healing is you can use it to enhance your meditation practice.
                        <br/><br/>
                        To meditate while channeling Chi Activation energy, students learn to tune deeply into the frequency they are connecting to. Since opening up to energy is a deeply pleasurable experience, you can use this pleasure to anchor yourself in deep meditation.
                        <br/><br/>
                        As humans, we gravitate towards pleasure and shy away from pain. 
                        So the greater the pleasure you experience while healing, the more you will naturally want to tune into and focus on this pleasure – something that will not only heighten your experience (what you focus on grows), but also help your mind to stay in the present moment.
                        Your mind gets distracted because it is either trying to improve your life, or because it is pondering how to avoid something that will make it worse.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-item">
                    <h2 class="text-pink">learn to live in the moment</h2>
                    <p>
                        You meditate, and your mind starts thinking about what you can eat for dinner (something that will potentially improve your life), or it thinks about paying your car registration (if you don’t do that and you lose your licence or get fined, your life will get worse).
                        <br/><br/>
                        In either case, it distracts you from the present moment. But when you luxuriate in the pleasure of the moment, in the exquisite energy that is coursing through your body while practising Chi Activation, then you will want to stay put where you are. You want to stay immersed in the pleasurable sensations. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        As a result, it will be harder for your mind to pull you away from what you are doing since you won’t want to stop doing it!
                        And if your mind does distract you for a moment, you’ll want to get straight back to where you were.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-item">
                    <h2 class="text-pink">meditate with chi activation energy</h2>
                    <p>
                        So when you practice Chi Activation Meditation, you’ll typically find it easier than normal to stay in a meditative state because the strong flow of pleasurable energy makes it easier to anchor yourself in the present moment.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Better still, when you meditate with Chi Activation energy, your body will fill up with invigorating, healing energy that will uplift your entire day.
                        Do Chi Activation ‘healing meditation’ in the morning, and you’ll feel a difference in your body and mood. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        You’ll be more energized, and you’ll be more balanced. 
                        You’ll be happier, and you’ll be mentally clearer and brighter.

            <h2>Why Chi Activation ? Will Help Your Current <br/>
                Meditation/Spiritual Practice</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Because Chi Activation will help you to channel more energy, it will also improve whatever current meditation/spiritual practice (e.g. yoga, t’ai chi, shiatsu, qigong, etc.) you are doing. Practice your kata, or asanas or healing movements, and you’ll notice that they thrum with extra energy. Do your current meditation, and delight in all the additional chi that now flows through your body. 
                    And, like we said, since this will make your current practices more enjoyable, the pleasure you experience will help anchor you more fully in the present moment, and as a result, will improve the meditation component of your practice.
                    So try Chi Activation, and enjoy getting an upgrade to your current spiritual/meditation practice.<br/>

                <p>They run a course over two days and that's that. Students are not primed before the course to help them get the most out of it, and they are not guided afterwards (to ensure mastery and follow through of the techniques learned). This means that even though almost everyone enjoys whichever healing course they take, most students don't get nearly as much out of it as they could.
                    <br/>
                    Perhaps in part due to his background in teaching (Jeremy lectured and tutored at the University of Melbourne), and in part due to experience, Jeremy soon realized that students needed a lot more support to extract the maximum from his course. As a result, he introduced both some pre-course exercises and a post-course 21-day program.
                    <br/>
                    The pre-course work is simple to do, and includes some important guided meditation practices as well as general information on how best to prepare for your course (this part is found in the 'pre-course' section of the video portal).
                    <br/>
                    The meditations can easily be done by anyone – even students who haven't practised meditation before – and they will ensure you are energetically ready to get the most out of your weekend.
                    <br/>
                    The post-course 21-day program is done via email and video, and involves us sending you daily emails with techniques to practice, and further information to deepen everything you have learned.
                    <br/>
                    With thousands of students going through Jeremy's healing courses, he knows the likely challenges you will face post-course, and his 21-day program is designed to not just help you overcome these but also develop real confidence in everything you have learned.

                    While some people will naturally doubt the effectiveness of online learning, Chi Activation Healing is perfectly suited to it. Designed to work both in a classroom and over distance, its energy can easily cross time and space – and witnessing this will, as much as anything, help you to break through many of the limiting healing beliefs that stifle so many people's spiritual growth.
                    <br/>
                    Having taught in-person healing courses for 13 years before teaching his first online ones, Jeremy can confidently say – from his experience of both – that online ones work just like regular ones and, for some people, may even be more powerful.
                    <br/>
                    <span class="text-special">Why Online Chi Activation Classes Are Not Like Regular Online Classes</span>
                    While typical Zoom classes may be tough to get through (they can be monotonous with too much screen time, etc.), a healing course is different. Sure, some of our class time will be used to discuss the mechanics and technique behind powerful healing techniques, but much of the time we will be meditating and doing healing work, and that means we won’t be staring at the screen. So you’ll actually find that the course will not only be a lot easier than you think, it will also be not only a deep healing experience, but also enjoyable. We provide complimentary tea (mostly herbal) and a selection nibbles (nuts, chips and – the very necessary! – dark chocolate) the like).

                <p>Chi Activation Healing Technique (CAHT, for short) is a powerful new high-vibrational healing modality that enables students to tap deeply into their innate healing potential.
                    <br/>
                    Perfect for students of other modalities who are ready to further expand their healing abilities, Level 1 uses a series of powerful energy activations to attune students to 5 healing energies, ranging from ultra-grounding to ultra-high vibrational frequencies.
                    <br/>
                    So with an extensive range of healing energies at your disposal, you'll be able to pick the most appropriate energy frequency to heal both yourself and others.
                    <br/>
                    Want to ground? Chi Activation has you covered. Want to tune into your Higher Self? Covered again.
                    <br/>
                    Chi Activation Healing has three increasingly advanced levels, and will ultimately teach you both to tap into unlimited energy frequencies and to heal with the mind.
                    So if you have found yourself plateauing with other healing systems, or if you know you can get more out of your innate healing abilities, give it a try. Chi Activation Healing will leverage everything you have already done and take it to new heights.
                    <br/>

                <h2 class="uppercase text-center">How chi-activation courses work</h2>
                <p class="text-content">Chi Activation is an advanced healing method that teaches practitioners to tap into chi energy (also known as ‘qi’, ‘ki’, ‘prana’, ‘shakti’ and ‘spiritual energy’) to heal both themselves and others.
                    <br/>
                    While on the surface it resembles healing methods like Reiki, it seeks more to develop a healer’s intuition and innate healing abilities. Importantly, it does this while enabling practitioners to stay grounded and energetically protected at all times.
                    <br/>
                    Since what you learn in Chi Activation doesn’t overlap with the skills learned in healing methods like Reiki, it is not only great for those setting out on their healing journey, but also those who are already experienced energy workers and healers.
                </p>
                <h2 class="uppercase text-center">How chi-activation - Level 1 works</h2>
                <p>
                    Your Chi Activation Level 1 course is carefully crafted so that all of its parts work harmoniously together. Step by step, you’ll connect more and more to your innate healing abilities, enabling you to progressively channel more and more chi (energy).
                    <span>clear your meridians - enhance your energetic sensitivity</span>
                    After introductions and an overview of what you’ll be learning, the course proper will begin with a powerful meditation to clear your meridians (your body’s energy channels) and enhance your energetic sensitivity. The meditation will help you to clear energetic blocks and heal areas that are energetically depleted. At its conclusion, you will feel relaxed, centred and primed for the day’s meditations and attunements.
                    This meditation will also harmonize and enhance the group’s energy, enabling everyone to learn faster than they would alone.

                <p class="column-2">
                    One of the challenges many healers face is that they are more sensitive than the average person. This is both a blessing and a curse. It helps them to intuit the best way to help someone, but it also means they can more easily be affected by negative/low vibrational energy.
                    <br/>
                    In fact, the majority of people attending a healing course find that they are often drained by negative environments, people and needy friends. They are by nature givers and helpers, but this can come back to bite them when the people they are helping drain them of energy.
                    <br/>
                    The great thing about Chi Activation Healing is that you will never get drained while giving it, and you will even learn techniques to help avoid such things in everyday life.
                    <br/>
                    In particular, the course teaches students to connect to their base chakra, their Earth Star chakra (found below the soles of their feet) and the Earth. 
                    <br/>
                    By harnessing these three energies, they will find it far easier to navigate even busy and scattered environments.

                        your soul star chakra. Found some 6 inches above your crown, it is less well known than your body's seven main chakras, but connecting to it will enable you to channel greater quantities of energy from Source.

                        During your class, you will receive a most powerful crown chakra activation that will make it easier for you to connect to Source energy. 
                        <br/>
                        This activation, in conjunction with the activation of the minor chakras in the palms, will enable you to easily perform hands-on healing right from the very day of the course

                        <br/>
                        In the course, you will not only receive a palm chakra activation, you will also be taught a powerful meditation for stimulating and sensitizing these (minor) chakras.

            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>One of the challenges of getting stuck both with ‘energy vampires’ and in ‘low vibrational’ places is that we can all too easily start focusing on the negative. Do too much of this, and (thanks to the law of attraction) you will end up attracting to yourself the very things your fear. That is why so many healers still get drained when they head out into crowds or when they help their needy friend – even when they employ their ‘defensive’ techniques!
                    <br/><br/>
                    They visualize all sorts of things to stay protected, but still end up getting ‘slimed’.
                    In this course, Jeremy teaches another approach to staying energetically safe – one where you raise your vibration to the point that negative energy simply doesn’t stick.
                    By using this technique, you can keep your mind focused on the good things, improve your state of wellbeing and keep safely out of harm’s way.

                <p>As the name of this course suggests, Chi Activation is all about learning to draw chi energy from Source. 
                    <br/>
                    Since it is not your energy, the process will never see you lose any personal energy. In fact, the more energy you give to another using our technique, the better you will feel.
                    <br/>
                    In the course, you will learn to summon chi energy at will – energy you can then give to either yourself or others (or even – as mentioned – to plants and animals).
                    <br/>
                    Chi Activated CatIn particular, we attune you to 5 distinct healing frequencies (covering a wide range of healing energies), meaning that you'll have great versatility with your healing. You can ground someone, connect them to their high self, heal their heart chakra – whatever!
                    <br/>
                    With so many healing energies to choose from, you will always find an excellent one to work with – no matter what the issue, and during the course, you'll practice all five frequencies on both yourself and other students. As a result, you will walk away confident and ready to use your new skills.

                <p class="text-center">Unlike Reiki, healing in our method is completely intuitive. So although we may discuss certain hand positions for specific healing purposes, in general, you’ll learn to trust your gut and allow your intuition to guide you from position to position.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Chi Healing can be done both with touch or without. Both are equally effective.
                    So while students will spend much time employing light physical touch, they will also do critical work on the auric field. Since many conditions originate there, this is often a cucial component to re-establishing wellbeing.

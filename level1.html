                    Chi Activation Healing Technique (CAHT, for short) is a powerful new high-vibrational healing modality that enables students to tap deeply into their innate healing potential.
                    <br/>
                    Perfect for students of other modalities who are ready to further expand their healing abilities, Level 1 uses a series of powerful energy activations to attune students to 5 healing energies, ranging from ultra-grounding to ultra-high vibrational frequencies.
                    <br/>
                    So with an extensive range of healing energies at your disposal, you'll be able to pick the most appropriate energy frequency to heal both yourself and others.
                    <br/>
                    Want to ground? Chi Activation has you covered. Want to tune into your Higher Self? Covered again.
                    <br/>
                    Chi Activation Healing has three increasingly advanced levels, and will ultimately teach you both to tap into unlimited energy frequencies and to heal with the mind.
                    So if you have found yourself plateauing with other healing systems, or if you know you can get more out of your innate healing abilities, give it a try. Chi Activation Healing will leverage everything you have already done and take it to new heights.

                <h2 class="uppercase text-center">How chi-activation courses work</h2>
                <p class="text-content">Chi Activation is an advanced healing method that teaches practitioners to tap into chi energy (also known as ‘qi’, ‘ki’, ‘prana’, ‘shakti’ and ‘spiritual energy’) to heal both themselves and others.
                    <br/>
                    While on the surface it resembles healing methods like Reiki, it seeks more to develop a healer’s intuition and innate healing abilities. Importantly, it does this while enabling practitioners to stay grounded and energetically protected at all times.
                    <br/>
                    Since what you learn in Chi Activation doesn’t overlap with the skills learned in healing methods like Reiki, it is not only great for those setting out on their healing journey, but also those who are already experienced energy workers and healers.
                </p>
                <h2 class="uppercase text-center">How chi-activation - Level 1 works</h2>
                <p>
                    Your Chi Activation Level 1 course is carefully crafted so that all of its parts work harmoniously together. Step by step, you’ll connect more and more to your innate healing abilities, enabling you to progressively channel more and more chi (energy).
                    <span>clear your meridians - enhance your energetic sensitivity</span>
                    After introductions and an overview of what you’ll be learning, the course proper will begin with a powerful meditation to clear your meridians (your body’s energy channels) and enhance your energetic sensitivity. The meditation will help you to clear energetic blocks and heal areas that are energetically depleted. At its conclusion, you will feel relaxed, centred and primed for the day’s meditations and attunements.
                    This meditation will also harmonize and enhance the group’s energy, enabling everyone to learn faster than they would alone.

                <p class="column-2">
                    One of the challenges many healers face is that they are more sensitive than the average person. This is both a blessing and a curse. It helps them to intuit the best way to help someone, but it also means they can more easily be affected by negative/low vibrational energy.
                    <br/>
                    In fact, the majority of people attending a healing course find that they are often drained by negative environments, people and needy friends. They are by nature givers and helpers, but this can come back to bite them when the people they are helping drain them of energy.
                    <br/>
                    The great thing about Chi Activation Healing is that you will never get drained while giving it, and you will even learn techniques to help avoid such things in everyday life.
                    <br/>
                    In particular, the course teaches students to connect to their base chakra, their Earth Star chakra (found below the soles of their feet) and the Earth. 
                    <br/>
                    By harnessing these three energies, they will find it far easier to navigate even busy and scattered environments.

                        During your class, you will receive a most powerful crown chakra activation that will make it easier for you to connect to Source energy.

            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>One of the challenges of getting stuck both with ‘energy vampires’ and in ‘low vibrational’ places is that we can all too easily start focusing on the negative. Do too much of this, and (thanks to the law of attraction) you will end up attracting to yourself the very things your fear. That is why so many healers still get drained when they head out into crowds or when they help their needy friend – even when they employ their ‘defensive’ techniques!
                    <br/><br/>
                    They visualize all sorts of things to stay protected, but still end up getting ‘slimed’.
                    In this course, Jeremy teaches another approach to staying energetically safe – one where you raise your vibration to the point that negative energy simply doesn’t stick.
                    By using this technique, you can keep your mind focused on the good things, improve your state of wellbeing and keep safely out of harm’s way.

                <p>As the name of this course suggests, Chi Activation is all about learning to draw chi energy from Source. 
                    <br/>
                    Since it is not your energy, the process will never see you lose any personal energy. In fact, the more energy you give to another using our technique, the better you will feel.
                    <br/>
                    In the course, you will learn to summon chi energy at will – energy you can then give to either yourself or others (or even – as mentioned – to plants and animals).
                    <br/>
                    Chi Activated CatIn particular, we attune you to 5 distinct healing frequencies (covering a wide range of healing energies), meaning that you'll have great versatility with your healing. You can ground someone, connect them to their high self, heal their heart chakra – whatever!
                    <br/>
                    With so many healing energies to choose from, you will always find an excellent one to work with – no matter what the issue, and during the course, you'll practice all five frequencies on both yourself and other students. As a result, you will walk away confident and ready to use your new skills.

                    Chi Healing can be done both with touch or without. Both are equally effective.
                    So while students will spend much time employing light physical touch, they will also do critical work on the auric field. Since many conditions originate there, this is often a cucial component to re-establishing wellbeing.

            <p>To make sure students can both remember and go over material taught (and, quite often, even extend it!), all students will have access to our Chi Activation Level 1 video portal which you can access on both your desktop and mobile devices.

                The video portal includes all of the meditations conducted during the course (and relpaces a manual). So you can go through the techniques and meditations time and time again after the course. It is a unique feature of our courses that helps take your healing to a deeper level.</p>

            <p class="column-2 text-left">When Jeremy first started teaching healing full-time almost 15 years ago, he taught it (in this case, Reiki) as he had been taught. This meant that students did pretty well what they did everywhere else: they rocked up for the course, attended it and then said 'ciao'!
                <br/><br/>
                Nowadays it seems crazy to teach like this, but this is what almost everyone – even to this day – still does.
                <br/><br/>
                Reiki Rocks by the Sea<br/>
                They run a course over two days and that's that. Students are not primed before the course to help them get the most out of it, and they are not guided afterwards (to ensure mastery and follow through of the techniques learned).
                <br/><br/>
                This means that even though almost everyone enjoys whichever healing course they take, most students don't get nearly as much out of it as they could.
                <br/><br/>
                Perhaps in part due to his background in teaching (Jeremy lectured and tutored at the University of Melbourne), and in part due to experience, Jeremy soon realized that students needed a lot more support to extract the maximum from his course.
                <br/>
                As a result, he introduced both some pre-course exercises and a post-course 21-day program.
                <br/><br/>
                The pre-course work is simple to do, and includes some important guided meditation practices as well as general information on how best to prepare for your course (this part is found in the 'pre-course' section of the video portal).
                <br/><br/>
                The meditations can easily be done by anyone – even students who haven't practised meditation before – and they will ensure you are energetically ready to get the most out of your weekend.
                <br/><br/>
                The post-course 21-day program is done via email and video, and involves us sending you daily emails with techniques to practice, and further information to deepen everything you have learned.
                <br/><br/>
                With thousands of students going through Jeremy's healing courses, he knows the likely challenges you will face post-course, and his 21-day program is designed to not just help you overcome these but also develop real confidence in everything you have learned.

                <p>We currently hold our Melbourne Reiki courses in our beautiful studio in Brunswick Street, Fitzroy North, opposite the Edinburgh Gardens. The studio is light and luminous, has a state-of-the-art aircon unit for both heating and cooling (we're talking unbelievably fresh air!), and is perfect high-energy oasis that's close to everything.</p>
                <h2 class="mt-70 text-pink uppercase">Public Transport and free all day parking</h2>
                <p>Our Reiki venue is blessed with public transport to within 70 metres of the door and free all-day parking opposite (along the park in Brunswick Street).
                    It is also within easy cycling distance for anyone who lives in Clifton Hill, Carlton, Northcote and Collingwood.</p>
                <h2 class="mt-70 text-pink uppercase">Denver (Daylesford) class event</h2>
                <p>Set on 100-acres by the side of state forest, our new centre is an ideal place to connect to healing energies and meditate. Watch the sunset from the course hall. Spy on the kangaroos from our deck. Take photos of the echidnas, cockatoos, wallabies, deer and other wildlife that often grace our property. With nature all around, you'll find it easy to relax, recharge, and expand your innate healing abilities.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Filled with light all year round, our elegant studio has a wood heater to snuggle up to in winter, an aircon to chill by in summer, and views to delight in whichever way you look. So from the moment you arrive, you'll be cocooned by soothing energy and ready to dive deep into your healing explorations.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In between Woodend and Daylesford, our centre is easy to find and only 65 minutes from Melbourne. It is also only fifteen minutes from Kyneton, Trentham and Malmsbury. So if you choose to make a weekend away of it, you'll find plenty of nearby accommodation venues.</p>

                    So if you decide to enrol, commit to coming, be there rain, hail or shine. There is great power in that, and it will ensure you have an amazing experience.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Remember: after enrolling, doubts sometimes come up. This is normal. Your ego - your small self - is not just afraid of change, it knows that Reiki will create change! It knows how powerful it is. So if your ego resists, laugh at it and trust the intuition, the inner guidance or inspiration that had you enrol in the first place. It will never fail you.</p>

            <h3>channel your healing frequencies</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Chi Activation Level 2 is where your ability to channel healing energy really ramps up. 
                    By leveraging your connection to the five key energy frequencies you tapped into in level 1, you now learn to tune into almost any frequency you desire.
                    <br/>    
                    In other words, in Chi Activation Level 2, there is no limit to the amount of frequencies you can channel. Better still, once you learn to tap into healing frequencies at will, you are then ready to learn the art of ‘vibrational balancing’.
                    <br/>
                    To understand vibrational balancing, think of noise cancellation technology. 
                    To reduce background sounds, it uses what you may see as an inverse sound wave (technically, a sound that is ‘phase-inverted’ by 180 degrees). So you have a sound wave. You fire off its opposite, and the two of them neutralize each other, leaving no sound. 
                    <br/>
                    The principle of vibrational healing is the same, only instead of balancing sound waves, we are balancing energy frequencies.
                    <br/>
                    This is made clearer when we think of organs. They all have a healthy vibrational range, and if they begin to vibrate outside of this range, health issues occur. So with vibrational healing, the idea is to help reattune the body, mind, emotions, etc., to a healthy frequency by balancing the unhealthy frequency with a ‘counter frequency’.
                    <br/>
                    Like a tuning fork, this counter frequency then draws the imbalance into healthy alignment.
                    Of course, to be capable of finding the right counter frequency, you need to be able to access a huge range of energies, and that is exactly what Chi Activation Level 2 teaches you to do.

                <h2 class="uppercase text-center">expanding your frequency range<br/> <span>with aura frequency training</span></h2>
                <p>Level 1 went a long towards expanding the range of healing frequencies you could tap into. From the Earth Star Chakra to the Soul Star Chakra, you learned to tune into both deeply grounding frequencies and extremely high-vibrational ones.
                    <br/>
                    Level 2 takes this further through a series of activations and energy exercises that teach you to tap into a range of frequencies that has no theoretical limit. To help you master this skill, we use more chakra activations as a tool to expand the range of frequencies you can tap into and your energetic sensitivity.
                    <br/>
                    To begin, we finish off attuning you to the remaining chakras in your body - the base, the navel, the solar plexus and the throat chakras.
                    <br/>
                    Then we activate the bindu chakra: 
                    a lesser-known energy centre on the back of the head.
                    This completes stage 1 of our energy tuning process, after which we work with both Mayan and chakra chimes to teach students to tune into a vast array of frequencies both in the body and auric field.
                    <br/>
                    We also do specific ‘aura frequency training’ – something that helps students not only tune into a potentially infinite amount of energies, but also tune into both their body and other people’s bodies. This is a critical step on the way to mastering the art of vibrational balancing.

                <h2 class="uppercase text-center">the art of self-healing</h2>
                <p>As soon as you can tap into a vast range of healing frequencies, you are then able to begin the process of vibrational balancing on yourself.
                    To do so, you will learn to tune into your energy field and detect both areas that are out of balance and areas you would like to energetically enhance.
                    So you can use vibrational healing to both heal and optimize the body.
                    <br/><br/>
                    You can use it for mental, emotional and physical issues (although, like with most other complementary healing arts, you can never legally make any medical promises).

                <p>Chi Activation vibrational healing is both effective and easy to use on others. To perform it, a practitioner simply tunes into a client’s energy field and detects any areas of energetic imbalance (or if none exist – something that is unlikely – areas that could be energetically enhanced).
                    <br/><br/>
                    The process is one of ‘feeling’ and ‘intuition’, but it isn’t wishy-washy. When you ‘tune in’ to someone, you will get a distinct, specific feel for what areas could benefit from energetic balancing In this sense, Chi Activation vibrational healing is extremely targeted, as you will not only work on specific areas of the body, you will also balance them with specific frequencies. So unlike other ‘single-frequency’ modalities, you will have a greater chance of finding the ideal vibrational healing match.

                    The process is intuitive and precise, so just like with self-healing, there are no formal hand-positions. Since each person has unique energetic needs, every session targets different areas of their body and auric field.

            <p class="column-2">To make sure students can both remember and go over material taught (and, quite often, even extend it!), all students will have access to our Chi Activation Level 1 video portal which you can access on both your desktop and mobile devices. 
                <br/>
                The video portal includes all of the meditations conducted during the course (and relpaces a manual). So you can go through the techniques and meditations time and time again after the course. It is a unique feature of our courses that helps take your healing to a deeper level.

                <p>We currently hold our Melbourne Reiki courses in our beautiful studio in Brunswick Street, Fitzroy North, opposite the Edinburgh Gardens. The studio is light and luminous, has a state-of-the-art aircon unit for both heating and cooling (we're talking unbelievably fresh air!), and is perfect high-energy oasis that's close to everything.</p>
                <h2 class="mt-70 text-pink uppercase">Public Transport and free all day parking</h2>
                <p>Our Reiki venue is blessed with public transport to within 70 metres of the door and free all-day parking opposite (along the park in Brunswick Street).
                    It is also within easy cycling distance for anyone who lives in Clifton Hill, Carlton, Northcote and Collingwood.</p>
                <h2 class="mt-70 text-pink uppercase">Denver (Daylesford) class event</h2>
                <p>Set on 100-acres by the side of state forest, our new centre is an ideal place to connect to healing energies and meditate. Watch the sunset from the course hall. Spy on the kangaroos from our deck. Take photos of the echidnas, cockatoos, wallabies, deer and other wildlife that often grace our property. With nature all around, you'll find it easy to relax, recharge, and expand your innate healing abilities.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Filled with light all year round, our elegant studio has a wood heater to snuggle up to in winter, an aircon to chill by in summer, and views to delight in whichever way you look. So from the moment you arrive, you'll be cocooned by soothing energy and ready to dive deep into your healing explorations.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In between Woodend and Daylesford, our centre is easy to find and only 65 minutes from Melbourne. It is also only fifteen minutes from Kyneton, Trentham and Malmsbury. So if you choose to make a weekend away of it, you'll find plenty of nearby accommodation venues.</p>

            <div class="level-text-top text-center">
                <p>Although we offer a full-refund satisfaction guarantee for those who attend our Level 2 course, we do not offer a refund if you change your mind about our course without attending it. If you give us two weeks' notice, however, we will be happy to alter the date of your course.
                    <br/><br/>
                    If you wish to change dates between 13-3 days before the course, you will be charged a $100 change-of-date fee.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We cannot change the date of the course if we are given 2 or less days.
                    <br/><br/>
                    So if you decide to enrol, commit to coming, be there rain, hail or shine. There is great power in that, and it will ensure you have an amazing experience.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Remember: after enrolling, doubts sometimes come up. This is normal. Your ego - your small self - is not just afraid of change, it knows that Reiki will create change! It knows how powerful it is. So if your ego resists, laugh at it and trust the intuition, the inner guidance or inspiration that had you enrol in the first place. It will never fail you.</p>

            <h3>channel your healing frequencies</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Chi Activation Level 2 is where your ability to channel healing energy really ramps up. 
                    By leveraging your connection to the five key energy frequencies you tapped into in level 1, you now learn to tune into almost any frequency you desire.
                    <br/>    
                    In other words, in Chi Activation Level 2, there is no limit to the amount of frequencies you can channel. Better still, once you learn to tap into healing frequencies at will, you are then ready to learn the art of ‘vibrational balancing’.
                    <br/>
                    To understand vibrational balancing, think of noise cancellation technology. 
                    To reduce background sounds, it uses what you may see as an inverse sound wave (technically, a sound that is ‘phase-inverted’ by 180 degrees). So you have a sound wave. You fire off its opposite, and the two of them neutralize each other, leaving no sound. 
                    <br/>
                    The principle of vibrational healing is the same, only instead of balancing sound waves, we are balancing energy frequencies.
                    <br/>
                    This is made clearer when we think of organs. They all have a healthy vibrational range, and if they begin to vibrate outside of this range, health issues occur. So with vibrational healing, the idea is to help reattune the body, mind, emotions, etc., to a healthy frequency by balancing the unhealthy frequency with a ‘counter frequency’.
                    <br/>
                    Like a tuning fork, this counter frequency then draws the imbalance into healthy alignment.
                    Of course, to be capable of finding the right counter frequency, you need to be able to access a huge range of energies, and that is exactly what Chi Activation Level 2 teaches you to do.

                <h2 class="uppercase text-center">expanding your frequency range<br/> <span>with aura frequency training</span></h2>
                <p>Level 1 went a long towards expanding the range of healing frequencies you could tap into. From the Earth Star Chakra to the Soul Star Chakra, you learned to tune into both deeply grounding frequencies and extremely high-vibrational ones.
                    <br/>
                    Level 2 takes this further through a series of activations and energy exercises that teach you to tap into a range of frequencies that has no theoretical limit. To help you master this skill, we use more chakra activations as a tool to expand the range of frequencies you can tap into and your energetic sensitivity.
                    <br/>
                    To begin, we finish off attuning you to the remaining chakras in your body - the base, the navel, the solar plexus and the throat chakras.
                    <br/>
                    Then we activate the bindu chakra: 
                    a lesser-known energy centre on the back of the head.
                    This completes stage 1 of our energy tuning process, after which we work with both Mayan and chakra chimes to teach students to tune into a vast array of frequencies both in the body and auric field.
                    <br/>
                    We also do specific ‘aura frequency training’ – something that helps students not only tune into a potentially infinite amount of energies, but also tune into both their body and other people’s bodies. This is a critical step on the way to mastering the art of vibrational balancing.

                <p>As soon as you can tap into a vast range of healing frequencies, you are then able to begin the process of vibrational balancing on yourself.
                    To do so, you will learn to tune into your energy field and detect both areas that are out of balance and areas you would like to energetically enhance.
                    So you can use vibrational healing to both heal and optimize the body.
                    <br/><br/>
                    You can use it for mental, emotional and physical issues (although, like with most other complementary healing arts, you can never legally make any medical promises).

                <p>Chi Activation vibrational healing is both effective and easy to use on others. To perform it, a practitioner simply tunes into a client’s energy field and detects any areas of energetic imbalance (or if none exist – something that is unlikely – areas that could be energetically enhanced).
                    <br/><br/>
                    The process is one of ‘feeling’ and ‘intuition’, but it isn’t wishy-washy. When you ‘tune in’ to someone, you will get a distinct, specific feel for what areas could benefit from energetic balancing In this sense, Chi Activation vibrational healing is extremely targeted, as you will not only work on specific areas of the body, you will also balance them with specific frequencies. So unlike other ‘single-frequency’ modalities, you will have a greater chance of finding the ideal vibrational healing match.

            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Like all good healing modalities, you can use Chi Activation for distance healing. This begins with an ‘energy scan’, after which the practitioner aligns and balances the energy in the client’s body.
                    <br/>
                    The process is intuitive and precise, so just like with self-healing, there are no formal hand-positions. Since each person has unique energetic needs, every session targets different areas of their body and auric field.
